# The-COVID-19-Story( Data Exploration and Visualization- Covid-19 Dashboard)
**The COVID-19 Story: Analyzing Data for Insights and Preparedness.**

**Overview**
Welcome to the **COVID-19 Data Exploration** and Visualization project! This project aims to explore, analyze and visualize the COVID-19 data to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on various aspects such as infection rates, healthcare systems, and socio-economic factors. By leveraging SQL queries, we examine datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform decision-making and public health strategies.
Later, **COVID-19 dashboard** is created using Tableau.The COVID-19 Data Visualization in Tableau aims to provide interactive and insightful visualizations of COVID-19 data to facilitate understanding, analysis, and decision-making during the pandemic. Leveraging Tableau's robust visualization capabilities, this project comprehensively explores key COVID-19 metrics, trends, and patterns.

**This proejcts follows 2 major steps:**

1.*Data Exploration using SQL*(Here MS-SQL Server is used) and,

2.**Creating a Covid-19 Dashboard* using Tableau.

**Data SourcesðŸ“ˆ**
Analyzing data sources from **https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths** to understand the progression and impact of COVID-19 across different regions and timeframes.

**Objectives**
-Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
-Investigate the relationship between COVID-19 metrics and demographic variables.
-Explore the impact of interventions (e.g., lockdowns, vaccinations) on the spread of the virus.
-Identify regional disparities and hotspots of infection.
-Create interactive dashboard that allow users to filter, drill down, and analyze data dynamically.

**Methodologies**
**STEPS -**

**1.Data Cleaning**
The Covid data from 'OurWorldData' is  cleaned and converted into 2 different datasets using Excel 
1. Covid Deaths Dataset - Contains the data about Covid deaths in the world till Dec 2023.
2. Covid Vaccinations Dataset - Contains the Vaccinations data till DEC 2023.

**2.Data Exploration**
Data Exploration is performed using **MS-SQL**
Utilizing SQL's powerful querying capabilities to extract, transform, and visualize COVID-related data, aiming to derive valuable insights for decision-makers and the community. 
Leveraging SQL's functionalities for aggregations joins, and statistical analysis to comprehend the multifaceted aspects of the pandemic.

**3.Data Visualization**
Using the explored data we create Dashboard in Tableau.
Features of Dashboard
-Interactive Dashboards: Explore COVID-19 data through interactive dashboards that allow users to filter, drill down, and analyze data dynamically.
-Geospatial Analysis: Visualize the geographical spread of COVID-19 using maps, enabling users to identify hotspots, trends, and regional disparities.
-Temporal Analysis: Track the progression of the pandemic over time, analyze trends, and identify critical milestones and fluctuations in key metrics.

**Data Visualization is performed on Tableau Public - Covid-19 Dashboard**

**Directory Structure**
/data: Contains raw data files used in the analysis.
/scripts: SQL scripts for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Setup Instructions**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install SQL database management system (DBMS) if not already installed.
Run SQL scripts in the /scripts directory in sequential order.
Review the output files and visualizations in the /results directory.
**Usage**
Modify SQL queries or scripts as needed for custom analysis.
Refer to documentation for detailed explanations of data sources and methodologies.
Share findings with stakeholders and decision-makers for informed decision-making.
